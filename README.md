# Motzel-PP---Playlist-editor
Since the playlist downloader from this site https://isitworthplaying.motzel.dev from motzel only let you create the playlist and doesnt let you change the playlist image or name, therefore I made this extension

Currently you can only change the name and the image of the playlist. will word on more extras.
In order to get it to work download the files. If you have python installed, you can use the python source file. if not use the .exe.

1: Put the playlist and the Image you want to use in the directory with the .exe/python-script and double click the .exe \
2: Doubleclick the .exe or start the python-script and then follow the instructions. \
3: When the exe or the script is finished, you good to go
